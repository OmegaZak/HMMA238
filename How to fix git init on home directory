You accidently ran a "git init" on the home directory (the wrong directory root) ? 
Moreover, you realize that when you make a "git status" all the folders on your computer appear ?

If you have added/committed the files, you may create a new directory root,
copy the location /home/user/.git  in this new directory.
Then do a git checkout HEAD --
After that, if there are no apparent problems , you can fix this problem by deleting .git (the subdirectory) with the command : rm -rf $HOME/.git 
NB : The variable $HOME is used for the location /home/user in UNIX

After that, try to redo "init" in the right directory 

For Windows users :

You have installed GIT on your Windows computer and set the root directory to the user's folder (c:/users/user)
You can apply what has been said above and delete c:/users/user/.git
